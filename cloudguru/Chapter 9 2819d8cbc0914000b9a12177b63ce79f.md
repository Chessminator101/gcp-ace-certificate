# Unmanaged instance groups

- you can group multiple VMâ€™s together and then monitor their aggregated activites
- deleting the group leaves the instances, so you need to delete them separately

# Managed instance groups

- you select an instance template (after you create it) and set autoscaling to on, then when the work exceeds a certain CPU, it just creates a new instance to balance the loud
- deleting the group deletes all the instances that the group owns
