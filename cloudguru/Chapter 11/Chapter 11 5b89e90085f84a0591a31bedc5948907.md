# Networking

We gonna talk about Software-Defined Networking (SDN)

## Routing

- where data should go next
- its about making a lot of local decisions about how to move data from one place to the other

Where does it happen:

- On the way to google’s network
- On the way to the right resource
- On the way from one resource to another
- And also in reverse

## How does data make its way from a client to google’s network

- Before the data goes to google’s network, it needs to go to the internet
- VPC (virtual private cloud) routing tier

Standard networking tier

Premium networking tier

### Sending data from google to an end user

### Sending data from user to google

Apart from the speed difference, standard routing also needs to know beforehands where the data needs to go before it gets to google’s network

POP = point of presence

## How does data makes it way from google’s frontdoor to a correct resource in our system

- Latency reduction
    - use servers physically close to clients
- Load balancing
    - if one machine gets too many requests, we create another machine, but we need to make sure that the load is then balanced between the two machines instead of still going to the first one, thats what load balancing is for
    - separate from autoscaling
- System design
    - Different servers may handle different parts of the system
    - especially when using microservices (instead of monolith)

## Types

Cross-region load balancing

Cloud Load Balancer

HTTP(S) Load Balancer

- handles Microservices

## Unicast vs Anycast

- routing schemes
- describe how data can get from one place to another

**Unicast**

- There is only one device in the world that can handle this, send it there

**Anycast**

- There are multiple devices that could handle this, send it to any one but ideally the closest

## Layer 4 vs Layer 7

- TCP (the primary protocol to send data over the internet) is ucually called Layer 4 (L4)
    - it works solely with IP addresses
    - Knows how to connect to one place to another and send a lot of data (but doesnt know anything about HTTP or HTTPS)
- HTTP and HTTPS (protocols that make up the web) work at Layer 7 (L7)
    - These know about URLs and paths (www.petstore.cz/path)
    - Built on a lower layer (TCP)
- Each layer is built on the one below it

## DNS

- Domain name system can be the first step in routing (translates [petstore.cz](http://petstore.cz) to an ip address)
- But that comes with a number of problems
    - Returns layer 4 IP address but doesnt know what the full path is (layer 4 cannot route L4 based on L7’s URL paths)
    - Chunky - sends all data into one resource instead of two
    - Sitcky - DNS lookup “locks on” and refreshing per request has high cost (TTL is a time that says how long until you lock on the IP adress, before making another lookup in DNS, which means that if TTL is long, clients might be talking to a dead machine or an overloaded one, if TTL is short, you make a lot of lookups which cost money)
    - Not Robust - Relies on the client to always doing the right thing

## How to move data from one resource to another

- we use VPC (global) is Virtual Private Cloud - your Private SDN in GCP
    - not just resource-resource - also manages the doors to outside & peers
- Subnets (regional) create logical spaces to contain resources
    - all subnets can reach all others globally without any need for VPNs
- Routes work exactly like traffic signs, inside of VPC they say, that if you want to go to X then next hop you need to go to Y (define “next hop” for traffic based on destination IP)
    - Routes are global
    - No route to the internet gateway means no such data can flow
- Firewall Rules (global) further filter data flow that would otherwise route
    - default firewall rules are restrictive inbound and permissive outbound (nothing can come in, everything can come out)
    

## IPs and CIDRs

IP address is `abc.def.ghi.jkl` (dotted quad) where each piece is 0-255

CIDR block is group of IP addresses specified in `<IP>/xy` notation

- Turn IP address into 32 bit binary number
- `/xy` in CIDR notation locks highest (leftmost) bits in IP address (0-32)
- `abc.def.ghi.jkl/32` is single IP address because all 32 bits are locked
- `abc.def.ghi.jkl/24` is 256 IP addresses because last 8 bits (`jkl`) can vary
- `0.0.0.0/0` means “any IP address” because no bits are locked
