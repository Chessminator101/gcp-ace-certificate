# Data flow

### Three core components

It is taking some data (information) and:

- moving it around (network services)
- processing it (compute services)
- remembering it (storage services)

### Mental models

to help us think about data flows

- simplified representation of reality which is used by your mind to anticipate events or draw conclusions
- Systems combine
    - build larger systems out of smaller ones (abstractions)
