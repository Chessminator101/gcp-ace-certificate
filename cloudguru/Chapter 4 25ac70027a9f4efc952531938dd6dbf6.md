# Intro to GCP products and Services

## Compute engine

- VM, Disks, Network
- just like a computer you can buy from the store, you can run anything on them
- when you have a large job, just spin up even thousands of compute engines and stop paying for them when the job is done

## App engine

- managed App platform

## Kubernetes Engine

- managed kubernetes / containers

## Cloud functions

- Event-driven serverless functions
- you set up events

## Cloud storage

- Object Storage and Serving
- gimme some data, and I will get it back for you
- you cant change data, but you can give it new data and tell it to forget about the old stuff
- Nearline - Archival Occasional Access Storage
- Coldline - Archival Rare Access Storage

## Persistent Disk

- VM attached disks
- works much like a hard drive does
- only connects to Compute Engine instances

## Cloud filestore

- sits between Cloud Storage and Persistent disk
- managed NFS server

## Cloud TPU

- tenserflow processing unit
- specialised hardware for ML

## Cloud SQL

- managed MySQL and PostgreSQL

## Cloud Spanner

- horizontally scalable relational DB

## Cloud Firestore

- strongly consistent Serverless document DB (noSql)

## Cloud Datastore

- horizontally scalable document DB

## Cloud Bigtable

- petabyte scale low latency nonrelational

## Cloud Dataflow

- data and analytics product
- stream/batch data processing

## Cloud Dataproc

- managed Spark and Hadoop

## Cloud Pub / Sub

- global real-time messaging
- can be used to connect almost anything to almost anything else
- one part of the system creates topics, another part of the system subscribes to the topic

## Google BigQuery

- Data warehouse and Analytics

## Virtual private cloud

- software defined networking

## Dedicated interconnect

- dedicated private network connection

## Cloud Load Balancing

- multi-region load distribution

## Stackdriver monitoring

- infrastructure and application monitoring

## Cloud Identity

- manage users, devices and apps

## Cloud IAM

- Resource access control
- who can do what to which things
